#this is a code sync editor

#Command to run 

  ### 'npm start' 

#in this command i already add build and production so no problem just run and open in browser

#thats it


### Realtime Online Code Sync Editor Project:

The Realtime Online Code Sync Editor is a web-based application that facilitates collaborative coding in real-time. The project is built using the following technologies: React.js, Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, and CodeMirror.

The main objective of this project is to enable multiple users to simultaneously edit and synchronize code within shared "rooms." When a user joins a room, the application creates a socket connection using Socket.io, establishing a real-time communication channel between the server and the connected clients.

The editor functionality is implemented using CodeMirror, a versatile and customizable code editor library. CodeMirror provides a user-friendly interface with syntax highlighting, code folding, and other convenient features for coding.

The core functionality of the Realtime Online Code Sync Editor includes:

1. Room Creation and Joining: Users can create or join existing rooms. Each room acts as a separate collaborative coding environment.

2. Real-time Code Synchronization: Whenever a user makes changes to the code in their editor, the modifications are instantly synced and reflected in real-time across all connected users within the same room. This synchronization is achieved through Socket.io, which broadcasts the changes to all connected clients, ensuring that everyone sees the most up-to-date code.

3. Copying Editor Data to New Users: When a user joins a room, the application copies the existing code in the editor to their local editor, ensuring that they have the same starting point as other participants. This way, new users can immediately see the existing codebase and start collaborating seamlessly.

The combination of React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and Socket.io allows for efficient server-client communication and real-time updates, enabling a smooth and collaborative coding experience. The use of CodeMirror enhances the editing capabilities and provides a familiar coding environment for users.

The Realtime Online Code Sync Editor project empowers developers to work together remotely, share ideas, and make simultaneous modifications to code in a highly interactive and collaborative manner.
